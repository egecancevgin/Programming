# Programming
This repository contains small projects on programming by Egecan Evgin. 
The aim of these projects is to practice basic programming theory and to give general information about various complexity analyzes and codes.


This repository is mostly written in Python and C++ languages and contains only basic theoretical topics. Code written in Python language have been prepared in accordance with the principles of PEP8 Clean Coding.
Code written in C++ language have been prepared in accordance with the C++ Core Guidelines.

Programming Topics:
- Finding the minimum and maximum values of an array
- Finding the unique elements of an array
- Reversing a string and returning the modified version
